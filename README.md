Have an old cell phone laying around? Donâ€™t know what to do with it? What if I told you that you could turn that old cell phone into a smartwatch!?! 

This code is intended to be installed on an Arduino to be used for a smartwatch. The smartwatch utilizes an LCD screen from a Nokia 1100 cell phone. You can find details about the build at this link:
